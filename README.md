# 🎓 LinkedIn Education URL Generator

A simple, client-side tool that generates direct links to LinkedIn profile education sections, with intelligent fallback options for profiles with limited education data.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart URL Generation**: Automatically creates both education section and main profile URLs
- **Input Validation**: Ensures proper LinkedIn URL format before processing
- **One-Click Copy**: Copy generated URLs to clipboard with visual feedback
- **Direct Access**: Click URLs to open them in new tabs
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no external libraries required
- **Client-Side Only**: All processing happens in the browser - no server required

## 🎯 Problem Solved

LinkedIn profiles have inconsistent URL structures for education sections:
- **Profiles with detailed education data**: Direct `/details/education/` URLs work perfectly
- **Profiles with minimal education data**: These direct links don't exist or fail to load

This tool generates both URL variants, allowing users to try the direct education link first and fall back to the main profile if needed.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input**: Enter any LinkedIn profile URL
2. **Processing**: Tool cleans the URL and removes any existing paths
3. **Generation**: Creates two versions:
   - Education Section URL: `profile-url/details/education/`
   - Main Profile URL: Original cleaned profile URL
4. **Usage**: Try education URL first, use profile URL as fallback

## 📱 Platform Compatibility

- ✅ **Desktop/Laptop**: Full functionality
- ✅ **Mobile**: Basic functionality (desktop recommended for optimal experience)
- ✅ **All Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### Basic Usage
1. Paste a LinkedIn profile URL: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/username/`
